I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, advised by **Prof. Ming Jin**.  
My research focuses on developing **temporally robust learning, optimization, and control algorithms** that remain reliable under non-stationarity, temporal drift, and evolving system dynamics. I am broadly interested in how intelligent decision-making systems can be made **stable, safe, and adaptive over time**.

My work spans several interconnected areas:
- **Optimization & Online Algorithms** — dynamic penalization, rank-1 semidefinite programming, distributed optimization    
- **Safe & Trustworthy AI** — reasoning stability, and robust behavior in agentic large language models
- **System Identification** — finite-time identification of stable and unstable systems using non-causal FIR models

Before joining Virginia Tech, I completed my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics) and my B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering at the **Jordan University of Science and Technology**, where I was advised by **Dr. Khaled Al-Janaideh**.  
During my Master’s, I worked on **system identification and model order estimation**, developing analytical techniques for reconstructing and understanding  dynamic systems.
